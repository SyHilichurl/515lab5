# Notes

## Materials Used
- **Microcontroller**: ESP32-C3 (Seeed XIAO ESP32-C3)
- **Sensors**: Adafruit MPU6050 (accelerometer + gyroscope)
- **LED**: Addressable RGB LED (WS2812-compatible)
- **Switch**: Low-voltage tactile pushbutton
- **Other Components**:
  - Resistors as needed for sensors/switch
  - Breadboard and jumper wires for prototyping
  - Enclosure designed for laser cutting

## Design Decisions
- **Modular Hardware Structure**: Components were separated into distinct roles.
- **Gesture Recognition Setup**: MPU6050 selected for compatibility with Edge Impulse and stability in motion tracking.
- **Enclosure**: Designed a compact, laser-cut thin veneer box that:
  - Protects components
  - Has openings for the led and wires to the switch
  - Is easy to assemble using interlocking slots
- **User Interaction**: A button allows for gesture data collection triggering, giving better control during training.

## Battery Information
- **Type**: Rechargeable Lithium-ion battery
- **Capacity**: 3.7V 500mAh
- **Power Supply Consideration**:
  - Chosen to support at least 1â€“2 hours of active usage.
  - Voltage regulator onboard ESP32-C3 supports direct battery connection.
  - USB port used for both programming and recharging.
